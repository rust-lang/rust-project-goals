# Project goals

This repo tracks the effort to set and track goals for the Rust project.

## Current goal period (2024h2)

There are [26 total goals](./2024h2/goals.md) established for the current goal period, which runs until the end of 2024. Of these, 3 were declared as flagship goals:

* **Continue simplifying Rust** by [releasing the Rust 2024 edition](./2024h2/Rust-2024-Edition.md).
* **Improve the experience of building network systems in Rust** by [bringing Async Rust experience closer to parity with sync Rust](./2024h2/async.md).
* **Enable safe abstractions for low-level systems** by [resolving the biggest blockers to Linux building on stable Rust](./2024h2/rfl_stable.md).

## Next goal period (2025h1)

The next goal period will be 2025h1 runs from Jan 1 to Jun 30. We are currently in the process of assembling goals. [Click here](./2025h1/goals.md) to see the current list. If you'd like to propose a goal, [instructions can be found here](./how_to/propose_a_goal.md).
