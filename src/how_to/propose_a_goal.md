# Propose a new goal

![Status: Accepting for 2025H1](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-accepting%20proposals%20for%202025H1-green)

## What steps do I take to submit a goal?

Goal proposed are submitted as Pull Requests:

* Fork the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-project-goals) and clone it locally
* Copy the [`src/TEMPLATE.md`](../TEMPLATE.md) to a file like `src/2025h1/your-goal-name.md`. Don't forget to run `git add`.
* Fill out the `your-goal-name.md` file with details, using the template and other goals as an example.
    * **The goal text does not have to be complete. It can be missing details.**
* Open a PR.

## Who should propose a goal?

Opening a goal is an indication that you (or your company, etc) is willing to put up the resources needed to make it happen, at least if you get the indicated support from the teams. These resources are typically development time and effort, but they could be funding (in that case, we'd want to identify someone to take up the goal). If you pass that bar, then by all means, yes, open a goal. 

Note though that controversial goals are likely to not be accepted. If you have an idea that you think people won't like, then you should find ways to lower the ask of the teams. For example, maybe the goal should be to perform experiments to help make the case for the idea, rather than jumping straight to implementation.

## Can I still do X, even if I don't submit a goal for it?

Yes. Goals are not mandatory for work to proceed. They are a tracking mechanism to help stay on course.
