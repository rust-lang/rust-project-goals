# Report status

Every accepted project goal has an associated tracking issue.

Owners are expected to provide regular status updates in the form of a comment indicating how things are going.

## Status updates are reported out

The status updates from the tracking issues are used to author a blog post for Inside Rust on a monthly basis.
If status updates are missing, the blog post will indicate that there is no status update.
This will also prompt the project to reach out and check on the progress of the goal.
If goal progress is slow for some reason -- maybe life intervened and you were not able to work on the goal --
it is much better to leave a status report to that effect than to say nothing at all.

## Goals without updates can be paused

If goals do not receive updates for an extended period of time, they may be marked as **paused**.
That's not meant as a judgment: things happen. It's just an indicator of the status.
You can also resume work again!

## Bot interactions

**Status:** Halluncinated. We need to author this code.

To aid in this process, the Rust triagebot will ping owners around the end of the month.
Pings will be placed as a comment on the tracking issue.
Owners should leave a comment in response; the bot will then hide its comment to avoid clutter.

## How to write a status update

Status updates should be written for general Rust contributors.
They will be posted to the [Inside Rust](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/)
Status updates should include the following information:

* What happened since the last update
    * Key decisions made
    * Milestones achieved
* Current plans
    * What is the milestone you are working towards
    * What is happening right now?
* Help wanted (if any)
    * Status updates are a great place to highlight requests for help or contribution

## Status update template

Here is a template you can use

```
### Since the last update...

*Describe any key decisions or events since the last update.*

### Up next

*Describe the next milestone you are working towards.*

### Help wanted

*Describe ways that contributors can help (if any, feel free to delete if contribution is not needed.)*

*Ideal here is to link to an issue with contribution instructions.*
```
