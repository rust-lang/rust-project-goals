## Summary

Over the next six months, we will continue our efforts from the 2025H1 goal to
merge nightly support for SVE and establish a path towards stabilisation:

- propose language changes which will enable scalable vector types to be
  represented in Rust's type system
- land an experimental nightly implementation of SVE
- identify remaining blockers for SVE stabilisation and plan their resolution
- gain a better understanding of SME's implications for Rust and identify first
  steps towards design and implementation

## Motivation

AArch64 is an important architecture for Rust, with two tier 1 targets and over
thirty targets in lower tiers. It is widely used by some of Rust's largest
stakeholders and as a systems language, it is important that Rust is able to
leverage all of the hardware capabilities provided by the architecture,
including new SIMD extensions: SVE and SME.

SIMD types and instructions are a crucial element of high-performance Rust
applications and allow for operating on multiple values in a single instruction.
Many processors have SIMD registers of a known fixed length and provide
intrinsics which operate on these registers. Arm's Neon extension is
well-supported by Rust and provides 128-bit registers and a wide range of
intrinsics.

Instead of releasing more extensions with ever increasing register bit widths,
recent versions of AArch64 have a Scalable Vector Extension (SVE), with vector
registers whose width depends on the CPU implementation and bit-width-agnostic
intrinsics for operating on these registers. By using SVE, code won't need to be
re-written using new architecture extensions with larger registers, new types
and intrinsics, but instead will work on newer processors with different vector
register lengths and performance characteristics.

SVE has interesting and challenging implications for Rust, introducing value
types with sizes that can only be known at compilation time, requiring
significant work on the language and compiler. Arm has since introduced Scalable
Matrix Extensions (SME), building on SVE to add new capabilities to efficiently
process matrices, with even more interesting implications for Rust.

Hardware is generally available with SVE, and key Rust stakeholders want to be
able to use these architecture features from Rust. In a recent discussion on
SVE, [Amanieu, co-lead of the library team, said][quote_amanieu]:

> I've talked with several people in Google, Huawei and Microsoft, all of whom
> have expressed a rather urgent desire for the ability to use SVE intrinsics in
> Rust code, especially now that SVE hardware is generally available.

While SVE is specifically an AArch64 extension, the infrastructure for scalable
vectors in Rust should also enable Rust to support for RISC-V's "V" Vector
Extension, and this goal will endeavour to extend Rust in an
architecture-agnostic way. SVE is supported in C through Arm's C Language
Extensions (ACLE) but requires a change to the C standard (documented in [pages
122-126 of the 2024Q3 ACLE][acle_sve]), so Rust has an opportunity to be the
first systems programming language with native support for these hardware
capabilities.

### The status quo

SVE is currently entirely unsupported by Rust, but progress is being made:

- [rfcs#3838] is open and proposes adding support for scalable vector types to
  the language. It has historically been blocked on requiring exceptions in the
  type system for these types to be considered `Sized` and act as value types.
  [rfcs#3729] addresses these blockers, so this RFC should be able to be
  advanced once [rfcs#3729] is ready
    - [rust#143924] has an proposed implementation for this relying on
      exceptions in the type system until an implementation of [rfcs#3729] is
      ready
    - It may be possible to land an implementation of this experimentally given
      that there is a realistic approach to resolving its implementation
      blockers
    - [stdarch#1509] is ready to add SVE types and intrinsics once
      [rust#143924] has added the infrastructure to support these types
- [rfcs#3729] proposes extending Rust's notion of sizedness to introduce a
  hierarchy of sizedness traits and a notion of const and non-const sizedness
  which unblocks `extern type`s and scalable vectors being treated as value
  types.
  - This RFC has had lots of discussion and two design meetings with the
    language team. There appears to be some consensus that it's approximately
    the right approach to the problem and has been approved for experimentation
    in the compiler.
  - [rust#137944] was merged implementing the first half of the RFC unstably. It
    introduced a hierarchy of sizedness traits, sufficient to unblock
    `extern type`s. It will be followed-up with a patch with the const and
    non-const sizedness, unblocking scalable vectors.

### The next 6 months

The primary objective of this initial goal is to land a nightly experiment with
SVE, have both RFCs accepted and establish a path towards stabilisation:

1. Resolve any and all follow-ups to [rust#137944] now that it has been merged
2. Merge a pull request with Part II of [rust#3729]'s implementation
3. Rewrite [rfcs#3838] in light of [rfcs#3729] to defer to [rfcs#3729]'s
   solutions for how scalable vectors will fit in the Rust type system
4. Rebase [rust#143924] on top of Part II of the Sized Hierarchy work, enabling
   it to be merged experimentally
5. Merge [stdarch#1509] adding SVE types and intrinsics
6. Identify and start addressing remaining stabilisation blockers

### The "shiny future" we are working towards

Adding support for Scalable Matrix Extensions in Rust is the next logical step
following SVE support. There are still many unknowns regarding what this will
involve and part of this goal or the next goal will be understanding these
unknowns better.

## Design axioms

- **Avoid overfitting.** It's important that whatever extensions to Rust's type
  system are proposed are not narrowly tailored to support for SVE/SME, can be
  used to support similar extensions from other architectures, and unblocks or
  enables other desired Rust features wherever possible and practical.
- **Low-level control.** Rust should be able to leverage the full capabilities
  and performance of the underlying hardware features and should strive to avoid
  inherent limitations in its support.
- **Rusty-ness.** Extensions to Rust to support these hardware capabilities
  should align with Rust's design axioms and feel like natural extensions of the
  type system.
