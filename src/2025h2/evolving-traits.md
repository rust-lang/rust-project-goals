## Summary

Unblock the evolution of key trait hierarchies:

* Adding [`Receiver`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Receiver.html)
  as a supertrait of [`Deref`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Deref.html).
* Allow the `tower::Service` trait to be split into a non-`Sync` supertrait and a
  `Sync` (thread-safe) subtrait.

The design should incorporate the feedback from the
[Evolving trait hierarchies](https://hackmd.io/6JId0y8LTyCzVMfZFimPqg)
language design meeting. The design should also set the stage for future changes to allow for
the more general case of splitting items out into supertraits.

## Motivation

Two significant motivating cases are discussed in [RFC 3437 "Implementable trait alias"](https://github.com/Jules-Bertholet/rfcs/blob/implementable-trait-alias/text/3437-implementable-trait-alias.md#deref--receiver--deref) under the heading "splitting a trait".

### Conceptual supertrait: `Deref: Receiver`

The `Deref` trait currently looks like this:

```rust
pub trait Deref {
    type Target: ?Sized;

    fn deref(&self) -> &Self::Target;
}
```

More recently, the `arbitrary_self_types` feature has motivated a more general `Receiver` trait:

```rust
pub trait Receiver {
    type Target: ?Sized;
}
```

Ideally, `Reciever` would be a supertrait of `Deref`:

```rust
pub trait Receiver {
    type Target: ?Sized;
}

pub trait Deref: Receiver {
    fn deref(&self) -> &Self::Target;
}
```

but this cannot be done today without a breaking change.

More details are in this Pre-RFC: [Supertrait associated items in subtrait impl](https://hackmd.io/@rust-for-linux-/SkucBLsWxl)

### Conceptual supertrait: `Iterator: LendingIterator`

Similarly, every type that implements today's `Iterator` trait could also (conceptually) be a `LendingIterator`:

```rust
pub trait LendingIterator {
    type Item<'a> where Self: 'a;
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item<'_>>;
}

pub trait Iterator {
    type Item;
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;
}
```

#### Missing or misnamed parent trait items

Note that, unlike `Deref` and `Receiver`, the names and signatures of the associated items in `LendingIterator` do not match those in `Iterator`. For existing `Iterator` types to implement `LendingIterator`, some bridge code between the two implementations must exist.


### Conceptual supertrait: relaxed bounds

A common practice in the `async` world is to use [the `trait_variant` crate](https://docs.rs/trait-variant/latest/trait_variant/) to make two versions of a trait, one with `Send` bounds on the futures, and one without:

```rust
#[trait_variant::make(IntFactory: Send)]
trait LocalIntFactory {
    async fn make(&self) -> i32;
    fn stream(&self) -> impl Iterator<Item = i32>;
    fn call(&self) -> u32;
}

// `trait_variant` will generate a conceptual subtrait:

trait IntFactory: Send {
    fn make(&self) -> impl Future<Output = i32> + Send;
    fn stream(&self) -> impl Iterator<Item = i32> + Send;
    fn call(&self) -> u32;
}
```

In this example, a type that implements `IntFactory` also satisfies the requirements for `LocalIntFactory`, but additionally guarantees that the returned types are `Send`.

### The status quo

Today's solutions include:

### Add a supertrait

#### Pros
* Matches the conceptual pattern between the traits: one clearly implies the other.
* The "standard" Rust way of doing things.

#### Cons
* Breaking change.
* Requires implementors to split out the implementation into separate `impl` blocks for each trait.

### Add a blanket impl

Rather than declaring `trait A: B`, one can create sibling traits with a blanket impl:

```rust
trait Supertrait {
  // supertrait items
}

trait Subtrait {
  // supertrait items + subtrait items
}

impl<T: Subtrait> Supertrait for T {
  // impl supertrait items using subtrait items
}
```

#### Pros
* Backwards compatible to introduce `Supertrait`

#### Cons

* Middleware impls are impossible! We'd like to write:

```rust
struct Middeware<T>(T);

impl<T: Supertrait> Supertrait for Middleware<T> { ... }

impl<T: Subtrait> Subtrait for Middleware<T> { ... }
```

but this overlaps with the blanket impl, and is rejected by the Rust compiler! This is a critical issue for `async` bridge APIs such as tower's `Service` trait, which wants to provide wrappers which implement the `trait_variant`-style `Send`-able when the underlying type implements the `Send` version (see [these notes from a previous design meeting](https://hackmd.io/rmN25qziSHKT4kv-ZC8QPw)).

Other nits:
* The directionality of the impl is less clear.
* Every shared item has two names: `<T as Supertrait>::Item` and `<T as Subtrait>::Item`. Relatedly, the bridge impl must exist even if items are identical.

### Provide no bridging

Another alternative is to provide two totally separate traits with no bridging, requiring users to manually implement both versions of the trait:

```rust
trait Supertrait { ... }
trait Subtrait { ... }

struct Impl { ... }

impl Supertrait for T { ... }
impl Subtrait for T { ... }
```

#### Pros

* Backwards compatible
* Middleware can be written to bridge either impl

#### Cons

* Requires duplication
* Requires users to restate bounds
* Existing code which implements `Subtrait` cannot be used as `Supertrait`, so APIs which require `Subtrait` cannot be relaxed to `Supertrait`

### The next 6 months

In the next six months, we aim to ship a solution which addresses the `Service` and `Receiver` use-cases
by allowing trait impls to implement supertraits *if* the impl itself contains a definition of an item
from the supertrait.

Traits will have to opt their impls into this behavior, possibly through the use of a keyword.
`auto` is used below as an example keyword:

```rust
// Library code:
trait Subtrait {
    fn supertrait_item();
    fn subtrait_item();
}
// User code:
impl Subtrait for MyType {
    fn supertrait_item() { ... }
    fn subtrait_item() { ... }
}

// -- can become --

// Library code:
trait Supertrait {
    fn supertrait_item();
}
trait Subtrait: Supertrait {
    fn subtrait_item();
}
// User code is unchanged from above, no separate `Supertrait`
// impl required
impl Subtrait for MyType {
    fn supertrait_item() { ... }
    fn subtrait_item() { ... }
}
```

### The "shiny future" we are working towards

In the future, we'd like it to be backwards-compatible for traits to split out arbitrary, possibly
defaulted items into supertraits.

This will be challenging, as it won't be obvious syntactically whether an impl intends to provide a
supertrait impl-- some degree of coherence / overlap resolution will be required. However, this feature
will provide library authors a great deal of flexibility while allowing for more ergonomic end-user
implementations.
