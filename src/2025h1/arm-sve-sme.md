*Arm's Rust team is @davidtwco, @adamgemmell, @jacobbramley, @JamieCunliffe and @Jamesbarford, as
well as @mrkajetanp and @harmou01 as graduates on rotation. This goal will be primarily worked on
by @davidtwco and @JamieCunliffe.*

## Summary

Over the next six months, we will aim to merge nightly support for SVE and establish a path
towards stabilisation:

- propose language changes which will enable scalable vector types to be represented in Rust's
  type system
- land an experimental nightly implementation of SVE
- identify remaining blockers for SVE stabilisation and plan their resolution
- gain a better understanding of SME's implications for Rust and identify first steps towards design
  and implementation

## Motivation

AArch64 is an important architecture for Rust, with two tier 1 targets and over thirty targets in
lower tiers. It is widely used by some of Rust's largest stakeholders and as a systems language, it
is important that Rust is able to leverage all of the hardware capabilities provided by the
architecture, including new SIMD extensions: SVE and SME.

### The status quo

SIMD types and instructions are a crucial element of high-performance Rust applications and allow
for operating on multiple values in a single instruction. Many processors have SIMD registers of a
known fixed length and provide intrinsics which operate on these registers. Arm's Neon extension
is well-supported by Rust and provides 128-bit registers and a wide range of intrinsics.

Instead of releasing more extensions with ever increasing register bit widths, recent versions of
AArch64 have a Scalable Vector Extension (SVE), with vector registers whose width depends on the CPU
implementation and bit-width-agnostic intrinsics for operating on these registers. By using SVE,
code won't need to be re-written using new architecture extensions with larger registers, new types
and intrinsics, but instead will work on newer processors with different vector register lengths
and performance characteristics.

SVE has interesting and challenging implications for Rust, introducing value types with sizes that
can only be known at compilation time, requiring significant work on the language and compiler.
Arm has since introduced Scalable Matrix Extensions (SME), building on SVE to add new capabilities
to efficiently process matrices, with even more interesting implications for Rust.

Hardware is generally available with SVE, and key Rust stakeholders want to be able to use these
architecture features from Rust. In a recent discussion on SVE, [Amanieu, co-lead of the
library team, said][quote_amanieu]:

> I've talked with several people in Google, Huawei and Microsoft, all of whom have expressed a
> rather urgent desire for the ability to use SVE intrinsics in Rust code, especially now that SVE
> hardware is generally available.

While SVE is specifically an AArch64 extension, the infrastructure for scalable vectors in Rust
should also enable Rust to support for RISC-V's "V" Vector Extension, and this goal will endeavour
to extend Rust in an architecture-agnostic way. SVE is supported in C through Arm's C Language
Extensions (ACLE) but requires a change to the C standard (documented in [pages 122-126 of the
2024Q3 ACLE][acle_sve]), so Rust has an opportunity to be the first systems programming language
with native support for these hardware capabilities.

SVE is currently entirely unsupported by Rust. There is [a long-standing RFC][rfc_sve] for the
feature which proposes special-casing SVE types in the type system, and [a experimental
implementation][impl_sve] on this RFC. While these efforts have been very valuable in understanding
the challenges involved in implementing SVE in Rust, and providing an experimental forever-unstable
implementation, they will not be able to be stabilised as-is.

This goal's owners have an nearly-complete RFC proposing language changes which will allow scalable
vectors to fit into Rust's type system - this pre-RFC has been informally discussed with members of
the language and compiler teams and will be submitted alongside this project goal.

### The next 6 months

The primary objective of this initial goal is to land a nightly experiment with SVE and
establish a path towards stabilisation:

- Landing a nightly experiment is nearing completion, having been in progress for some time. Final
  review comments are being addressed and both [RFC][rfc_sve] and [implementation][impl_sve] will
  be updated shortly.
- A comprehensive RFC proposing extensions to the type system will be opened alongside this goal.
  It will primarily focus on extending the `Sized` trait so that SVE types, which are value types
  with a static size known at runtime, but unknown at compilation time, can implement `Copy`
  despite not implementing `Sized`.

### The "shiny future" we are working towards

Adding support for Scalable Matrix Extensions in Rust is the next logical step following SVE
support. There are still many unknowns regarding what this will involve and part of this goal or the
next goal will be understanding these unknowns better.

## Design axioms

- **Avoid overfitting.** It's important that whatever extensions to Rust's type system are proposed
  are not narrowly tailored to support for SVE/SME, can be used to support similar extensions
  from other architectures, and unblocks or enables other desired Rust features wherever possible
  and practical.
- **Low-level control.** Rust should be able to leverage the full capabilities and performance of
  the underlying hardware features and should strive to avoid inherent limitations in its support.
- **Rusty-ness.** Extensions to Rust to support these hardware capabilities should align with
  Rust's design axioms and feel like natural extensions of the type system.
