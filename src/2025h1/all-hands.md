## Summary

Organise another Rust All-Hands in 2025!

## Motivation

It's been too long since we've had a Rust All-Hands. Time to bring it back!

### The status quo

Previous Rust All-Hands events were very useful and succesful, but after the changes at Mozilla, we haven't had a Rust All-Hands in six years.
Meanwhile, the project has grown a lot, making it much harder and expensive to organise a new Rust All-Hands.

A few months ago, when Jack brought up having a new Rust All-Hands in the Leadership Council meeting,
Mara proposed having the new Rust All-Hands at [RustWeek 2025](https://2025.rustweek.org) by [RustNL](https://2025.rustweek.org/about/), which will take place in the Netherlands around the 10th birthday of Rust 1.0.
Both RustNL and the Rust Leadership Council agreed.

See https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2024/09/02/all-hands.html

### The next 6 months

- Prepare the all-hands and everything around it.
- Have a social and informal "pre-all hands day" on Rust's 10th birtday: May 15, 2025.
- Have a two-day all-hands on May 16 and May 17, 2025.

### The "shiny future" we are working towards

The immediate goal is a very succesful and productive Rust All-Hands 2025.
Hopefully, this will be the first step towards the larger goal of having regular Rust All-Hands again.

We should be able to use the feedback and lessons learned from this event for the next ones,
and to figure out what the right frequency would be (yearly or less often).
Repeating an event tends to be much easier than organising one from scratch.

## Design axioms

- Accessibility. Ideally, everyone in the project should be able to attend the Rust All-Hands
- Productivity and effectivity. We should optimally make use of the event, to make it worth everyone's time.
- Low stress. The event or the planning of it should not burn anyone out. It is a tool to help the project and its members, after all!
- Space for social events. The goal is not just to work on technical things together, but also to get to know each other and become a closer team.
