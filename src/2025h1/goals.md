# Goals

This page lists the <!-- #GOALS --> project goals **proposed** for 2025h1.

> Just because a goal is listed on this list does not mean the goal has been accepted.
> The owner of the goal process makes the final decisions on which goals to include

## Flagship goals

Flagship goals represent the goals expected to have the broadest overall impact. 

<!-- GOALS 'Flagship' -->

## Other goals

These are the other proposed goals. 

**Orphaned goals.** Some goals here are marked with the ![Help wanted][] badge for their owner. These goals are called "orphaned goals". Teams have reserved some capacity to pursue these goals but until an appropriate owner is found they are only considered provisionally accepted. If you are interested in serving as the owner for one of these orphaned goals, reach out to the mentor listed in the goal to discuss.
