# Call for PRs: YYYYHN goals

> **NOTE:** This is a sample blog post you can use as a starting point.
> To begin a new goal season (e.g., 2222H1), do the following:
>
> * Copy this file to to the `blog.rust-lang.org` repository as a new post.
> * Search and replace `YYYYHN` with `2222H1` and delete this section.
> * Look for other "TBD" sections, you'll want to replace those eventually.

**As of today, we are officially accepting proposals for Rust Project Goals targeting YYYYHN (the (TBD) half of YYYY).** If you'd like to particiapte in the process, or just to follow along, please check out the [YYYYHN goal page][YYYYHN]. It includes listings of the goals currently under consideration , more details about the goals program, and instructions for how to submit a goal.

## What is the project goals program and how does it work?

Every six months, the Rust project commits to a set of goals for the upcoming half-year. The process involves:

* the owner of the goal program (currently me) posts a call for proposals (this post);
* would-be goal points of contact [open PRs][] against the [rust-project-goals] repository;
* the goal-program owner gathers feedback on these goals and chooses some of them to be included in the RFC proposing the final slate of goals.

To get an idea what the final slate of goals looks like, check out the RFC from the previous round of goals, [RFC (TBD)][]. The RFC describes a set of goals, designates a few of them as flagship goals, and summarizes the work expected from each team. The RFC is approved by (at least) the leads of each team, effectively committing their team to prove the support that is described.

## Should I submit a goal?

Opening a goal is an indication that you (or your company, etc) is willing to put up the resources needed to make it happen, at least if you get the indicated support from the teams. These resources are typically development time and effort, but they could be funding (in that case, we'd want to identify someone to take up the goal). If you pass that bar, then by all means, yes, open a goal. 

Note though that controversial goals are likely to not be accepted. If you have an idea that you think people won't like, then you should find ways to lower the ask of the teams. For example, maybe the goal should be to perform experiments to help make the case for the idea, rather than jumping straight to implementation.

## Can I still do X, even if I don't submit a goal for it?

Yes. Goals are not mandatory for work to proceed. They are a tracking mechanism to help stay on course.

## Conclusion

The Rust Project Goals program is driving progress, increasing transparency, and energizing the community. As we enter the second round, we invite you to contribute your ideas and help shape Rust's future. Whether you're proposing a goal or following along, your engagement is vital to Rust's continued growth and success. Join us in making Rust even better in 2025!
