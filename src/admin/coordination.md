# Team coordination

## Discussion channels

The [project-goals channel][pg] on Zulip is used for discussing the "meat" of project goals: e.g., updates, proposed goals, etc.

The [project-goals/meta channel][pgm] on Zulip is used for meta discussions about running the program itself rest.

[pgm]: https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/478266-project-goals.2Fmeta

To broadcast updates about the status of the goal program, we create a goal in every goal program correpsonding to running the program. Updates posted on that tracking issue will be posted in `project-goals`.

## Meetings

We do not currently have a regularly scheduled meeting. Sync meetings are coordinated ad-hoc and typically take place on Zulip in the [project-goals/meta channel][pgm].

## Tracking our work

To track work items, we use [issues tagged with the `meta` label](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-project-goals/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Ameta) on the [rust-lang/rust-project-goals](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-project-goals/) repository.

Issues [tagged with "help wanted"](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-project-goals/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22) indicates places where we would like somebody to jump in. **Every such issue will also be tagged with mentoring instructions giving some idea how to get started.**

There are also "meta" milestones for each program period to track specific goals related to that period.
