# TEMPLATE (replace with title of your goal)

> **Instructions:** Copy this template to a fresh file with a name based on your plan.
> Give it a title that describes what you plan to get done in the next 6 months
> (e.g., "stabilize X" or "nightly support for X" or "gather data about X").
> Feel free to replace any text with anything, but there are placeholders
> designed to help you get started.
>
> The **point of contact** is the person responsible for providing updates.
>
> The **status** should be **Proposed** for new goals or **Accepted** once approved.
>
> If your goal **needs** something to proceed, add one or more `Needs` rows:
> * `Needs | Contributor` — the goal needs someone to step up and do the work.
>    The project goals team will try to help you find someone.
> * `Needs | Funding` — the goal needs funding to proceed.
>
> If you add a 'need', please add a section in the summary giving more details.

## Summary

*Short description of what you will do over the next year.*

## Motivation

### The status quo

> *Elaborate in more detail about the problem you are trying to solve. This section is making the case for why this particular problem is worth prioritizing with project bandwidth. A strong status quo section will (a) identify the target audience and (b) give specifics about the problems they are facing today. Sometimes it may be useful to start sketching out how you think those problems will be addressed by your change, as well, though it's not necessary.*

### What we propose to do about it

> *Explain your overall approach to solving the problem. Explain your design philosophy (including design axioms). Focus your discussion on what you aim to get done this year, but it is good to also give a sense for the "overall goal" you are working towards, if it extends beyond the work for this year. Team(s) should give you feedback on whether they are aligned both with your short-term and longer-term goals.*

### Work items over the next year

> *Sketch out the specific things you are trying to achieve in this goal period. This should be short and high-level -- we don't want to see the design!*

## Team asks

> This section outlines what support you need from the Rust teams. For each team, identify the level of support you need:
>
> * Small: You only need the team to do its routine activities, or you simply need the team's approval.
>     * *Example:* Prototyping a new feature on crates.io that you hope to eventually upstream.
>     * *Example:* Conducting research that might eventually become a language feature.
>     * *Example:* A compiler change that will require a few small PRs to be reviewed.
>     * *Example:* Asking the lang team to approve a lint.
> * Medium: You need dedicated support from one person, but the rest of the team doesn't have to do much.
>     * *Example:* A compiler change that doesn't require any rearchitecting but 
>     * *Example:* Implementing a small, noncontroversial language feature.
> * Large: You need deeper review from the entire team.
>     * *Example:* Rearchitecting part of the compiler.
>     * *Example:* Implementing a complex language feature that will require design meetings.
>
> If you're not sure, leave it blank, the project goals team can help.
>
> "Small" asks require someone on the team to "second" your goal; "Medium" and "Large" asks require a dedicated champion from the team. If you don't have a second or a champion, the project goals team will help you find them, don't worry about it.

## Frequently asked questions

### What do I do with this space?

*This is a good place to elaborate on your reasoning above -- for example, why did you put the design axioms in the order that you did? It's also a good place to put the answers to any questions that come up during discussion. The expectation is that this FAQ section will grow as the goal is discussed and eventually should contain a complete summary of the points raised along the way.*
