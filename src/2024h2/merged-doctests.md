## Motivation

Most of the time in doctests is spent in compilation. Merging doctests and compiling them together allows to greatly reduce the overall amount of time.

### The status quo

### The next few steps

* Finish reviewing the [pull request](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/126245)
* Run crater with the feature enabled by default.
* Merge it.

### The "shiny future" we are working towards

Merged doctests.
