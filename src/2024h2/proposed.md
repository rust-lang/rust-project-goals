# Proposed goals

This page lists the goals currently under consideration, with the exception of [flagship goals](./flagship.md), which are listed separately.

Some goals here are listed without an owner (look for the ![Help wanted][] badge). These indicate a place where we are looking for someone to step up and help drive the goal the goal to completion. Every orphaned goal has someone who is willing and able to serve as mentor, but lacks the time or resources to truly *own* the goal. If you are interested in serving as the owner for one of these orphaned goals, reach out to the listed mentor to discuss.
