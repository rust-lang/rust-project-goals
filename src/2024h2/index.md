# 2024 goal process

Rust is trying something new! The 2024 goal process is an attempt to build up a slate of project goals.
The process is [owned][] by [nikomatsakis][] and the plan is to (a) produce an initial slate of goals;
(b) track their progress over the second half of the year; and (c) author an RFC that defines a more permanent
program going forward.
You can read more about it in the delightfully meta [Project Goal #1](./0001-Project-goal-slate.md).

## Where are we at

We are currently collecting **proposed** goals. You can see the current set on the left.
If you'd like to propose a goal, read more in the [how to propose a goal](../how_to/propose_a_goal.md) section.
