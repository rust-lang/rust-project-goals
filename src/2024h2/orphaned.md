# Orphaned goals

Goals in this section are "pre-approved" by the team but lack an owner. These indicate a place where we are looking for someone to step up and help drive the goal the goal to completion. Every orphaned goal has someone who is willing and able to serve as mentor, but lacks the time or resources to truly *own* the goal. If you are interested in serving as the owner for one of these orphaned goals, reach out to the listed mentor to discuss. Orphaned goals may also be used as the basis of applying for grants from the Rust Foundation or elsewhere.
