## Preapproved goals in need of owners

*The team would like to commit to the goal, but the goal lacks an owner (this may be because owner is seeking funding)*

None

## WIP goals

*These goals are still in draft form. They do not represent consensus. Expect changes. The goal column should describe the specific things you aim to get done in 2024H2; the theme ties those into a larger theme (it's ok to put N/A). [Would you like to propose a goal?](../how_to/propose_a_goal.md)*

None.
