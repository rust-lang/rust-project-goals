## Preapproved goals in need of owners

*The team would like to commit to the goal, but the goal lacks an owner (this may be because owner is seeking funding)*

None

## WIP goals

*These goals are still in draft form. They do not represent consensus. Expect changes. The goal column should describe the specific things you aim to get done in 2024H2; the theme ties those into a larger theme (it's ok to put N/A). [Would you like to propose a goal?](../how_to/propose_a_goal.md)*

## Not accepted goals

*The team does not want to commit to this goal, either because it doesn't seem like sufficiently high priority or because they do not have sufficient confidence that the goal as framed will get done.*

None.
