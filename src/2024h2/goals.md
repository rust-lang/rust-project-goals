**Orphaned goals.** Some goals here are marked with the ![Help wanted][] badge for their owner. These goals are called "orphaned goals". Teams have reserved some capacity to pursue these goals but until an appropriate owner is found they are only considered provisionally accepted. If you are interested in serving as the owner for one of these orphaned goals, reach out to the mentor listed in the goal to discuss.
