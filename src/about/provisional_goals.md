# Provisional goals

**Provisional goals** are goals accepted without an assigned [owner](./owners.md).
Teams sometimes accept provisional goals to represent work that they feel is important
but for which they have not yet found a suitable owner.
Interested individuals who wish to improve Rust can talk to the teams
about becoming the owner for a provisional goal.
The existence of a provisional goal can also be helpful when applying for funding or financial support.
