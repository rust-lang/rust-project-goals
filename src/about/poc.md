# Goal point of contacts

Every goal has a single **point of contact**. This is the person responsible for authoring updates and generally tracking the status of the goal. They will get regular pings to provide updeates.

We require a single point of contact to avoid confusion. But of course it is possible for that person to delegate the actual authoring of updates to others.

For simple goals, the point of contact is usually the person who [owns](./owners.md) the implementation.
