# Motivation

Say something about the problem you aim to address. Try to answer the following questions:

* Who is the **target audience**? Is it a particular group of Rust users, such as those working in a specific domain? Contributors? 
* What is the **status quo**? What do they do now when they have this problem, and what are the shortcomings of that?
* What is the **shiny future**? What is the goal you are trying to achieve?

The motivation section is making the case for why this particular problem is worth prioritizing with project bandwidth. That bandwidth can be a very limited resource, so it's good to give details.

The most important thing in the motivation is the **status quo** -- showing the problems with the way things are now. The **shiny future** is definitely useful, but giving too many details about how you hope to address the problems risks people taking issue with your particular plan. The ideal is to cover the experience you are going for.
