# Goal motivations

The **motivation** section for a goal should sell the reader on why this is an important problem to address.

The first paragraph should begin with a concise summary of the high-level goal and why it's important.
This is a kind of summary that helps the reader to get oriented.

The **status quo** section then goes into deeper detail on the problem and how things work today.
It should answer the following questions

* Who is the **target audience**? Is it a particular group of Rust users, such as those working in a specific domain? Contributors? 
* What do these users do now when they have this problem, and what are the shortcomings of that?

The **next few steps** can explain how you plan to change that and why these are the right next steps to take.

Finally, the **shiny future** section can put the goal into a longer term context. It's ok if the goal doesn't have a shiny future beyond the next few steps.
