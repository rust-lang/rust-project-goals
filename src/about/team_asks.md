# Team asks

A **team ask** is the *thing that you need from a Rust team to make progress*. The precise asks can vary from "Discussion and moral support" (basically, regular vibe checks) up until specific RFC or stabilization decisions. Asks cannot require a specific outcome (e.g., the ask cannot be "guarantee me that you will accept the RFC), as project goals are not meant to substitute for a real decision process.

The list of recognized asks is shown below:

* The *Ask* column indicates the text that should appear in your project goal table.
* The *aka* column is a shorter name for the ask used in the condensed RFC tables.
* The *description* column describes what you are asking for.
