# Flagship goals

Each time period, the goal program owner selects a small set of the proposed goals (typically 2-3) as **flagship goals**. These goals are highlighted specially.

The criteria for a goal to be considered as a flagship goal:

* **Tell a story:** Flagship goals further some aspect of Rust's story that we want to be better understood.
* **Broad impact and interest:** Flagship goals should be impactful and/or interesting to a broad swath of Rust's user base.
* **Take time:** While not required, it is common that flagship goals take multiple goal sessions to complete. Therefore, the flagship goals often continue from goal period to goal period.
