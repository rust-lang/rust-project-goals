## Summary

*Short description of what you will do over the next year.*

## Motivation

### The status quo

> *Elaborate in more detail about the problem you are trying to solve. This section is making the case for why this particular problem is worth prioritizing with project bandwidth. A strong status quo section will (a) identify the target audience and (b) give specifics about the problems they are facing today. Sometimes it may be useful to start sketching out how you think those problems will be addressed by your change, as well, though it's not necessary.*

### What we propose to do about it

> *Explain your overall approach to solving the problem. Explain your design philosophy (including design axioms). Focus your discussion on what you aim to get done this year, but it is good to also give a sense for the "overall goal" you are working towards, if it extends beyond the work for this year. Team(s) should give you feedback on whether they are aligned both with your short-term and longer-term goals.*
