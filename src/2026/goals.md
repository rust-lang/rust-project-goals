# Goals

This page lists the (((#GOALS))) project goals **proposed** for 2026.

> Just because a goal is listed on this list does not mean the goal has been accepted.
> The owner of the goal process makes the final decisions on which goals to include
> and prepares an RFC to ask approval from the teams.

## Goals by work required

### Large goals

Large goals require the engagement of entire team(s). The teams that need to engage with the goal are highlighted in bold.

(((LARGE GOALS)))

### Medium goals

Medium goals require support from an individual, the team champion.

(((MEDIUM GOALS)))

### Smaller/vibes goals

Smaller or vibes goals are covered by standard team processes and do not require dedicated support from anyone.

(((SMALL GOALS)))

## Goals by champion

(((CHAMPIONS)))

## Goals by team

The following table highlights the support level requested from each affected team. Each goal specifies the level of involvement needed:

* **Vibes**: The team doesn't need to do anything, but the goal author wants to know they support the idea.
* **Small**: The team only needs to do routine activities (e.g., reviewing a few small PRs).
* **Medium**: Dedicated support from one team member, but the rest of the team doesn't need to be heavily involved.
* **Large**: Deeper review and involvement from the entire team (e.g., design meetings, complex RFCs).

"Vibes" and "Small" asks require someone on the team to "second" the goal. "Medium" and "Large" asks require a dedicated champion from the team.
