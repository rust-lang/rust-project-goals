## Summary

Stabilize the never type aka `!`.

## Motivation

### The status quo

The never type has been unstable for **10** years, with all previous attempts to stabilize it failing.
There is a plan to stabilize it, however it still needs to be implemented in reality. 

### What we propose to do about it

Implement the plan!
There are only a few outstanding issues to be solved.
After they are done, the never type can be stabilized.
