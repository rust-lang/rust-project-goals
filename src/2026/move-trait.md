## Summary

We propose to introduce new traits that describe what operations are possible on a type. Today Rust assumes all types can be moved (relocated in memory) and forgotten (via `mem::forget`). We will introduce traits like `Move` and `Forget` that make these capabilities explicit, allowing types to opt out. This follows the precedent set by the [Sized hierarchy work](./scalable-vectors.md), which relaxes the assumption that all types have a compile-time-known size. We will implement MVPs in the compiler, write RFCs, and validate viability through real-world testing in the Linux Kernel.

## Motivation

### The status quo

Rust has historically assumed that all values can be moved (relocated in memory) and forgotten (via `mem::forget`, without running destructors). These assumptions are baked into the language: assignment moves values, and `mem::forget` is safe. But some types need to opt out of these capabilities:

**Immobile types:** A lot of async futures want to be self-referential, but self-referential types can't be safely moved. The current solution is `Pin`, which encodes immovability as a property of *places* rather than *types*. This leads to significant complexity. As [The Safe Pinned Initialization Problem](https://rust-for-linux.com/the-safe-pinned-initialization-problem) describes, `Pin` struggles to safely encode self-referential types in systems like the Linux kernel.

**Guaranteed destructors:** Some types need their destructors to run. A `Transaction` type might require `commit()` or `rollback()` before cleanup. A scoped task handle must join before the scope exits. But `mem::forget` is safe, so Rust can't guarantee destructors run. This blocks patterns like safe scoped spawn for async, where the spawned task borrows from the parent scope.

### What we propose to do about it

We propose to generalize Rust's type system with new auto-traits that describe what operations are possible on a type. The framing is positive: traits represent capabilities. At the base layer, types may have no special capabilities. We then layer on the things we need:

- **`Move`**: The type can be relocated in memory.
- **`Destruct`**: The type can be implicitly dropped (destructor runs when it goes out of scope).
- **`Forget`**: The type can be forgotten via `mem::forget` without running its destructor.

This follows the precedent set by the [Sized hierarchy](./scalable-vectors.md) work. Just as that work relaxes "all types have compile-time-known size" to support scalable vectors, this work relaxes "all types can be moved" and "all types can be forgotten."

**The `Move` trait** encodes movability as a property of types rather than places:

```rust
#[lang = "move"]
unsafe auto trait Move {}
```

Types implementing `!Move` cannot be moved and must keep a stable address for their entire existence. This is simpler than `Pin` because immovability is a type property, not a place property. Construction of `!Move` types will rely on work from [#t-lang/in-place-init](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/528918-t-lang.2Fin-place-init).

**The `Forget` trait** lets types opt out of being forgettable:

```rust
// Types implementing !Forget must have their destructors run
unsafe impl !Forget for ScopedTaskHandle {}
```

With `!Forget`, we could build safe scoped spawn: the handle's destructor joins the task, and because the handle can't be forgotten, the join is guaranteed. This unblocks patterns that are currently impossible in safe Rust.

What is concretely out of scope for this year is anything related to changing or
updating the `Future` trait. This is the only stable trait in Rust which depends
on `Pin`, and would need a migration story to be able to use `Move`. However depending on `Pin` is not the only shortcoming `Future` has ([1] + [2] +  10 more issues), and so fixing the `Future` trait is best treated as a standalone project.

## Frequently asked questions

### How does this relate to the Sized hierarchy work?

The [Sized hierarchy](./scalable-vectors.md) work establishes the pattern: Rust can relax assumptions that were previously universal by introducing trait hierarchies that let types opt out. That work relaxes "all types have compile-time-known size" to support scalable vectors and extern types. This goal applies the same pattern to "all types can be moved" and "all types can be forgotten."

### How does this relate to the "pin ergonomics" initiative?

This work is an alternative to [Project Goal 2025H2: Continue Experimentation with Pin Ergonomics](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-project-goals/blob/main/src/2025h2/pin-ergonomics.md), which includes the following extensions:

 - A new item family `pin` in lvalues, e.g. `&pin x`, `&pin mut x`, `&pin const x`.
 - A one-off overload of Rust's `Drop` trait, e.g. `fn drop(&pin mut self)`.
 - A new item kind `pin` in patterns, e.g. `&pin <pat>`.

Notably this work does not solve [pin's duplicate definition
problem](https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/why-pin/), meaning that even with these extentions we still end up with `Trait` and `PinnedTrait` variants of existing
traits. The `Drop` trait being the exception to this, since the initiative is proposing to special-case it using a one-off overload.

Rather than trying to change the language to make `Pin` work, we believe the
problem is with `Pin` and we should improve the way immovable types are encoded
in Rust instead. With the eventual goal to deprecate `Pin` in Rust entirely.

Because Rust promises to stay backwards-compatible forever, making `pin` a
language-item on par with `&` and `mut` is something we'll forever need to keep
supporting. Given our eventual goal is to deprecate `Pin`, we do not believe
that we should make `pin` a part of the language. Which is why `Move` is not just a complimentary proposal, but intended as an alternative.

### What enables safe scoped spawn?

Safe scoped spawn requires guaranteed destructors. The pattern: spawn returns a handle whose destructor joins the task. If you could `mem::forget` the handle, the task could outlive the scope and access dangling references. With `!Forget`, the handle's destructor is guaranteed to run, making the pattern safe. This is one of the key motivations for the guaranteed destructors portion of this goal.

### Where can I read more about this design space?

Several blog posts explore this area:

- [Move, Destruct, Leak](https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2025/10/21/move-destruct-leak/) explores the trait hierarchy for destructors and forgetting. Note that unlike this post, we don't believe `Move` should be a supertrait of `Destruct`. It's useful to have types that can be destructed/dropped but not moved (e.g., self-referential types that need cleanup).
- [Must move types](https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2023/03/16/must-move-types/) introduces the concept of types that force callers to take specific actions.
- [Ergonomic Self-Referential Types for Rust](https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/self-referential-types/) and [its follow-up](https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/self-referential-types-2/) explore the `Move` trait design.
- [Why Pin is a part of trait signatures](https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/why-pin/) explains the problems with `Pin` that motivate this work.
- [Placing functions](https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/placing-functions/) proposes syntax for constructing `!Move` types in place.
