# Help wanted

The goals below are **invited goals**, meaning that the goal has a mentor but needs someone to do the actual implementation work. We are looking for people who are willing to commit to working on a weekly basis through the year. The [point of contact](../about/poc.md) listed on each goal is volunteering to mentor — reach out to them if you're interested in helping, or reach out to the project goals organizers.
