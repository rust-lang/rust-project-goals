# Highlights from the 2026 goals

There are a total of (((#GOALS))) planned for this year. That's a lot! You can see the complete list, but to help you get a handle on it, we've selected a few to highlight. These are goals that will be stabilizing this year or which we think people will be particularly excited to learn about.

**Important:** You have to understand the nature of a Rust goal. Rust is an open-source project, which means that progress only happens when contributors come and *make* it happen. When the Rust project declares a goal, that means that (a) contributors, who we call the *task owners*, have said they want to do the work and (b) members of the Rust team members have promised to support them. Sometimes those task owners are volunteers, sometimes they are paid by a company, and sometimes they supported by grants. But no matter which category they are, if they ultimately are not able to do the work (say, because something else comes up that is higher priority for them in their lives), then the goal won't happen. That's ok, there's always next year!
