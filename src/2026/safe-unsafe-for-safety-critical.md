## Summary

The Safety-Critical Rust Consortium will investigate real-world safety-critical codebases to identify common `unsafe` patterns, then work with t-opsem to create normative documentation in the Rust Reference and standard library docs.

## Motivation

### The status quo

Rust's `unsafe` documentation has gaps. The Rustonomicon self-describes as "incomplete" and the Unsafe Code Guidelines Reference is "largely abandoned." Neither is normative. When developers need to know whether a specific `unsafe` pattern is sound, they often find no authoritative answer.

This matters acutely in safety-critical domains. Automotive, medical, and aerospace software must demonstrate code behaves correctly. Without normative documentation, developers cannot build rigorous safety cases for `unsafe` code.

The [zerocopy crate](https://github.com/google/zerocopy) established a model: annotate every `unsafe` block with rationale citing official Rust documentation; when documentation is insufficient, work with t-opsem to improve it (e.g., [rust-lang/rust#114902](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/114902) for `addr_of!` semantics).

### What we'll do

We'll apply the zerocopy model systematically, starting with [Eclipse iceoryx2](https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2), a zero-copy IPC framework with ~3,300 `unsafe` usages. The process:

1. Catalog `unsafe` patterns in the codebase
2. Identify which patterns lack normative documentation
3. Work with t-opsem to establish correct safety contracts
4. Submit PRs to the Rust Reference and std docs

Priority areas include cross-process synchronization, memory-mapped regions, cross-process atomics, and `UnsafeCell` in shared memory—patterns common in systems programming but underdocumented.

### The "shiny future"

Developers writing `unsafe` code can cite authoritative documentation for safety contracts. Safety-critical projects can build rigorous safety cases. The patterns documented benefit the entire ecosystem, not just safety-critical users.

## FAQ

### Why iceoryx2?

It's a pure-Rust safety-critical IPC framework with extensive `unsafe` usage (shared memory, lock-free structures, FFI). The patterns it uses appear throughout the systems programming ecosystem.

### Won't this overwhelm t-opsem?

No. Most usages fall into ~20 pattern categories, of which 5-7 need new normative documentation. We're asking t-opsem to help with genuinely novel questions, not review thousands of individual usages.

### How does this differ from cataloging undefined behavior?

We document **safety contracts** (what you must do to be sound), not undefined behavior (what happens when you're unsound). The Rust Reference's UB list is intentionally non-exhaustive; we respect that approach.
