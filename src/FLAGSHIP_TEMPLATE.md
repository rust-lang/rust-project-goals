WRITING PRINCIPLES FOR FLAGSHIP THEMES

Tone and style:
- Be direct and informative, not promotional or hyperbolic
- Avoid dramatic language ("impossible choice", "stuck in limbo for years")
- State facts clearly; let the reader judge significance
- Match the tone of individual goal documents

Structure:
- Status quo explains the HIGH-LEVEL CONCEPT the theme addresses, not individual features
- Status quo identifies the problem or opportunity, then explains what improvements become possible
- "What we are shooting for" describes concrete outcomes, not implementation details
- Key use cases show what becomes possible, briefly
- Design axioms guide tradeoffs across the theme

Common mistakes to avoid:
- Listing individual goals in the status quo (that's what the goals table is for)
- Over-explaining each feature in detail (link to goal pages instead)
- Marketing language that oversells the importance
- Making the status quo too long with exhaustive problem descriptions

Good examples to follow:
- See "Beyond the `&`" for clean problem/solution structure
- See "Unblocking dormant traits" for infrastructure-enables-features framing

Length guidance:
- Status quo: 2-4 paragraphs explaining the high-level problem/opportunity
- What we are shooting for: 3-5 bullet points of concrete outcomes
- Key use cases: 3-5 brief scenarios
- Design axioms: 2-4 principles
- FAQ: 2-3 cross-cutting questions

> **Instructions:** Copy this template to `src/2026/flagship-your-theme-name.md`.
> Give it a title that captures the capability or experience users will gain
> (e.g., "Beyond the `&`" or "Constify all the things").
>
> Flagship themes group related goals under a unifying narrative. They explain
> *why* this collection of work matters to users, not just *what* we're building.
>
> Unlike individual goal pages, flagship themes don't have metadata tables or
> team asks—those live in the individual goal documents.

## Summary

*One sentence describing the capability users will gain when this theme is complete.*

## Motivation

### The status quo

> *Explain the high-level problem or opportunity from the user's perspective. A strong status quo section:*
> * *Identifies the underlying limitation or gap (not individual features)*
> * *Shows the consequences: what can't users do? what workarounds exist?*
> * *Connects to the goals: "with X fixed, we can do Y and Z"*
>
> *Keep it concise. The goal pages have details; this page provides the unifying narrative.*

### What we are shooting for

> *Paint a picture of the future in concrete terms. By the end of 2026:*
> * *Bullet points describing specific outcomes*
> * *Focus on what users can do, not implementation details*
> * *Use present tense ("Extern types work") not future tense ("Extern types will work")*

### Key use cases

> *List 3-5 specific scenarios this theme will enable. For each use case:*
> * *Name the use case in bold*
> * *One sentence explaining what becomes possible*
>
> *Example format:*
> * **Use case name**: Description of what users can do and why it matters.

### Design axioms

> *List the principles guiding decisions across all goals in this theme. Good design axioms:*
> * *Help resolve tradeoffs when they arise*
> * *Explain the "why" behind design choices*
> * *Are specific enough to be actionable*
>
> *Example format:*
> * **Axiom name.** Explanation of the principle and how it guides decisions.

## 2026 goals

(((FLAGSHIP GOALS: Theme Name)))

> *Replace "Theme Name" above with the exact name used in the `Flagship` metadata field of your goals. The preprocessor will automatically list all goals tagged with this theme.*

## Frequently asked questions

> *Address questions that span multiple goals in the theme. Individual goal FAQs should go in those goal documents; theme FAQs address cross-cutting concerns.*

### How do these goals relate to each other?

> *Explain how the goals in this theme connect. Are they sequential dependencies? Parallel efforts? Independent pieces of a larger puzzle?*
