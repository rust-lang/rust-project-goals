The Rust project is currently working towards a [slate of 26 project goals](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-project-goals/{{milestone}}/goals.html), with 3 of them designed as [Flagship Goals](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-project-goals/{{milestone}}/goals.html#flagship-goals). This post provides selected updates on our progress towards these goals (or, in some cases, lack thereof). The full details for any particular goal are available in its associated [tracking issue on the rust-project-goals repository](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-project-goals/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3AC-tracking-issue).
