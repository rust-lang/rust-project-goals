The Rust project is currently working towards a [slate of 26 project
goals](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-project-goals/2024h2/goals.html), with 3 of them designed as [Flagship
Goals](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-project-goals/2024h2/goals.html#flagship-goals). This post provides selected
updates on our progress towards these goals (or, in some cases, lack thereof). The full details for any particular goal
are available in its associated [tracking issue on the rust-project-goals
repository](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-project-goals/milestone/2).
