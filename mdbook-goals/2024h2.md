* compiler-errors has been working on removing the `eval_x` methods on `Const` that do not perform proper normalization and are incompatible with this feature.

* Stabilizing async closures: Lang team discussed syntax and reached preliminary consensus on `async Fn`, subject to also agreeing to include some of "async type" syntax, and next steps are for lang team to accept the RFC and to author stabilization report.

* Resolving "Send Bounds" via Return Type Notation: A call for testing of RTN was issued and PR https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/129629 was merged, and next step is to author a stabilization report.

* Dyn dispatch for async functions in traits: Preliminary implementation work on the `dynosaur` crate was done, and polish and public call for testing remain the next steps.

* Async drop experiments: There is a PR with pending work awaiting review, and @nikomatsakis has agreed to review.

* Async WG reorganization: No progress was made, and a meeting was scheduled but deferred.

* The next steps are improving diagnostics ([#131152](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/131152)) and fixing more holes before adding const traits back to core, with further testing required.

* Weihanglo explored the potential routes to use WASI as a default sandbox environment, including leveraging the official `build-rs` crate, shipping a Cargo-flavored WASI standard library, or continuing with other more mature sandbox runtime choices like Docker or eBPF while focusing on the configuration side.

<td colspan='3'>

* ZuseZ4 managed to enable autodiff support in dist builds with the help of the bootstrap team, allowing Rust to be added to the autodiff fork of the compiler explorer at https://enzyme.mit.edu/explorer/.

* Although there are still some dist issues related to finding `std` in the compiler explorer build, ZuseZ4's PR to add Enzyme/autodiff support to the test infrastructure was merged, potentially allowing a larger frontend PR to be added to the merge queue soon.

* After returning from travel, ZuseZ4 reported that the Autodiff frontend was merged, including over 2,000 lines of code and 30 files, leaving a smaller remaining diff.

* ZuseZ4 is considering a redesign of the Autodiff middle-end, switching from using Enzyme as a library to an LLVM pass-based approach, which could simplify the review process and provide additional features.

* ZuseZ4 opened a tracking issue for the GPU offload feature and made the first PR to enable LLVM's offload feature, and is seeking help to fix the Rust dist build used in the Enzyme Compiler explorer, which is encountering an error related to finding the `std` crate.

* The work by x-hgg-x on https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/14583 and https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/14614 has made significant progress towards extending PubGrub to match Cargo's dependency resolution capabilities.

* Lcnr mostly fixed the hang issue with two pull requests, but enabling the `-Znext-solver=coherence` feature still results in performance degradation due to nalgebra hitting the recursion limit with a wide search graph.

* There have been no other significant changes to the new solver during the last month.
