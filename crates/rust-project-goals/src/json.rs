//! Generate JSON summarizing the tracking issues.
//!
//! This module contains types (e.g., [`TrackingIssues`]) that represent the
//! external API that is used by the website
//! and other tools to consume the tracking issue data. They are very similar
//! to the types in `gh` and so forth but because they represent
//! a versioned API, we copy them over here to insulate them from incidental changes.
