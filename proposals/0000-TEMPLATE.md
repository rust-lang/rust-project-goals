## Summary

*OWNER* proposes to serve as owner for *GOAL TITLE* which will adddress

* Problem aspect #1
* Problem aspect #2

## Motivation

Say something about the problem you aim to address. Try to answer the following questions:

* Who is the **target audience**? Is it a particular group of Rust users, such as those working in a specific domain? Contributors? 
* What is the **status quo**? What do they do now when they have this problem, and what are the shortcomings of that?
* What is the **shiny future**? What is the goal you are trying to achieve?

The motivation section is making the case for why this particular problem is worth prioritizing with project bandwidth. That bandwidth can be a very limited resource, so it's good to give details.

The most important thing in the motivation is the **status quo** -- showing the problems with the way things are now. The **shiny future** is definitely useful, but giving too many details about how you hope to address the problems risks people taking issue with your particular plan. The ideal is to cover the experience you are going for.

## Design axioms

*Add your [design axioms][da] here. Design axioms clarify the constraints and tradeoffs you will use as you do your design work. These are most important for project goals where the route to the solution has significant ambiguity (e.g., designing a language feature or an API), as they communicate to your reader how you plan to approach the problem. If this goal is more aimed at implementation, then design axioms are less important. [Read more about design axioms][da].*

## Ownership and other resources

**Owner:** *Identify a specific person or small group of people if possible, else the group that will provide the owner*

*This section describes the resources that you the contributors are putting forward to address this goal. This includes people: you can list specific people or a number of people -- e.g., 2 experienced Rust engineers working 2 days/wk. Including details about experience level and background will help the reader to judge your ability to complete the work.*

*You can also include other resources as relevant, such as hardware, domain names, or whatever else.*

### Support needed from the project

*Identify which teams you need support from -- ideally reference the "menu" of support those teams provide. Some common considerations:*

* Will you be authoring RFCs? How many do you expect? Which team will be approving them?
    * Will you need design meetings along the way? And on what cadence?
* Will you be authoring code? If there is going to be a large number of PRs, or a very complex PR, it may be a good idea to talk to the compiler or other team about getting a dedicated reviewer.
* Will you want to use "Rust project resources"...?
    * Creating rust-lang repositories?
    * Issuing rust-lang-hosted libraries on crates.io?
    * Posting blog posts on the Rust blog? (The Inside Rust blog is always ok.)

## Milestones and rough plan

*Lay out a rough plan for your goal. What milestones do you aim to achieve and by when? The most important thing is the end-date, but including steps along the way is helpful to increase confidence that you will be able to create your plan -- and to help **you** know if you are on track!*

*Examples of milestones you might include would be .*

## Follow-up work

*The goal only covers the next 6 months of work. What is your vision longer term?*

## Frequently asked questions

### What do I do with this space?

*This is a good place to elaborate on your reasoning above -- for example, why did you put the design axioms in the order that you did? It's also a good place to put the answers to any questions that come up during discussion. The expectation is that this FAQ section will grow as the goal is discussed and eventually shoudl contain a complete summary of the points raised along the way.*
